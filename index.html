                <h2>Leadership Styles</h2>
                <p>Leadership styles refers to the broad approach adopted by a leader. All leaders (at least all those leaders who already have followers) have one. If you are already a leader, that includes you. You just might not know what it is yet. But your followers do!</p>
                <p>Style is often based on a leader’s own beliefs, personality, experiences, working environment and their assessment of the situation at the time.</p>

            <article class="autocratic leaderType">
                <h3>Autocratic, Democratic, and Free-Rein Leadership</h3>
                <p>Three common leadership styles that we all naturally gravitate to are:</p>
                <h4>Autocratic</h4>
                <p>Autocratic leadership, also known as authoritarian leadership, is a leadership style characterized by individual control over all decisions and little input from group members. Autocratic leaders typically make choices based on their ideas and judgments and rarely accept advice from followers. Autocratic leadership involves absolute, authoritarian control over a group.</p>
                <h5>Characteristics of Autocratic Leadership</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>• Little or no input from group members</p></li>
                    <li><p>• Leaders make the decisions</p></li>
                    <li><p>• Group leaders dictate all the work methods and processes</p></li>
                    <li><p>• Group members are rarely trusted with decisions or important tasks</p></li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article class="democratic leaderType">
                <h4>Democratic</h4>
                <p>Democratic leadership, also known as participative leadership, is a type of leadership style in which members of the
                group take a more participative role in the decision-making process.</p>
                <h5>Characteristics of Democratic Leadership</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>• Group members are encouraged to share ideas and opinions, even though the leader retains the final say over decisions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>• Members of the group feel more engaged in the process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>• Creativity is encouraged and rewarded.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article class="free-rein leaderType">
                <h4>Free-Rein</h4>
                <p>Free-rein leadership, also called Laissez-Faire, is a type of leadership style in which leaders are hands-off and allow group members to make the decisions. Mangers set objectives and employees are free to do whatever is appropriate to accomplish those objectives.</p>
